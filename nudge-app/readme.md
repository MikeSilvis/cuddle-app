# Cuddle App
<br>
## IMPORTANT
  You must now open the repo from the workspace and not the xcode
project. This is due to using a pod file

### Setup Pod
* `gem install cocoapods`
* `pod setup`

### Install Crashlytics
* Download the Mac app https://www.crashlytics.com/download/mac and then
install it.
* Run: `touch .crashlytics` and you should be all set

NOTE: You DO NOT need crashlytics to build the app...
Hopefully...

## TODO
  See Do.com
